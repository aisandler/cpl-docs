## 📊 Major Findings

### Digital Content Marketing Gap
**ALL competitors are weak in digital content marketing** - massive opportunity for CPL:
- BBG: Only 1,250 LinkedIn followers, NO educational content
- SLPS Law: Virtually NO digital presence
- MMPS: Only 350 followers
- **ALL competitors:** No video content, no partner brands, traditional marketing only

**CPL Can Dominate:**
- Video-first strategy (competitors have ZERO video)
- Partner personal brands (all are firm-centric only)
- Educational content (competitors do announcements)
- Target: 3,000+ LinkedIn followers in 12 months
