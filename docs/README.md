## 📊 Major Findings

### Digital Content Marketing Gap
**ALL competitors are weak in digital content marketing** - massive opportunity for CPL:
- BBG: Only 1,250 LinkedIn followers, NO educational content
- SLPS Law: Virtually NO digital presence
- MMPS: Only 350 followers
- **ALL competitors:** No video content, no partner brands, traditional marketing only

**CPL Can Dominate:**
- Video-first strategy (competitors have ZERO video)
- Partner personal brands (all are firm-centric only)
- Educational content (competitors do announcements)
- Target: 3,000+ LinkedIn followers in 12 months

### Website SEO Opportunity
**Solid technical foundation, missing strategic optimization:**
- ✅ Good technical infrastructure (SSL, sitemaps, WordPress/Yoast)
- ⚠️ **Missing schema markup** (biggest quick win)
- ⚠️ **No keyword optimization** (meta descriptions, focus keyphrases)
- ⚠️ **Limited local SEO** (service area targeting)

**SEO Quick Wins Identified:**
- Schema markup implementation (rich snippets in search)
- Meta description optimization (10-20% CTR improvement)
- Keyword targeting setup (Yoast configuration)
- Internal linking strategy (better PageRank distribution)

**Expected Impact:** Top 3 rankings for 10+ keywords within 90 days
