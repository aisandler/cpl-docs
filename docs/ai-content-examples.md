**3 things I tell every broker about co-op board packages 👇**

After 15+ years closing NYC residential deals at every price point, these are the ones that save headaches:

**1. Start the conversation early**
The worst surprises happen when we're 2 weeks from closing and discover the board package requirements. Loop me in when you have the offer accepted—not when the clock is ticking.

**2. "Complete" means complete**
Missing one bank statement or reference letter? The board won't review it. Period. I send my clients a checklist, but your clients need to know: half-done = not done.

**3. Board interview prep matters (even for cash deals)**
I've seen $3M cash deals crater because buyers went in unprepared. 15 minutes of prep saves everyone a migraine.

Here's the thing most attorneys won't tell you: **The package reflects on YOU.**

When your buyers show up organized and professional, you look good. When they don't, you're the one getting the frustrated call from the listing agent.

That's why we treat your reputation like our own.

**Questions about a deal?** You know where to find me. 📱

**Tax strategy belongs at the BEGINNING of commercial deals. Not the end. 🧮⚖️**

Most commercial real estate attorneys hand you great legal work.

But they miss the tax implications until it's too late to do anything about them.

That's where having both a CPA license AND a law degree changes the game.

**Here's what I mean:**

Last month, a client was about to structure a $12M acquisition as a straight asset purchase.

Legally clean. Financing approved. Ready to close.

**But the tax bill?** Would have cost them an extra $340K.

Because I'm looking at both sides—legal AND tax—we restructured it as a 1031 exchange paired with specific LLC layering.

**Result:** Same deal, same timeline, $340K saved.

The broker looked like a hero. The lender closed smoothly. The client kept more of their money.

**That's service sophistication.**

Not just getting deals done. Getting them done SMART.

#### **Post Content:**

**You just closed on your biggest investment.**

**Now protect it. 🏠**

Most NYC property owners don't think about estate planning until something forces them to.

But here's what we've learned after decades in real estate law:

**Your property closing is actually the PERFECT time to handle estate planning.**

Why?

✅ **All your financials are already gathered** (no scrambling for documents)
✅ **You're already thinking about asset protection** (momentum is your friend)
✅ **Your attorney already knows your situation** (no starting from scratch)

**At CPL, we're one of the only NYC real estate firms that integrates both.**

Real estate → Estate planning → Comprehensive protection.

Not two separate attorneys. Not coordination headaches. One relationship.

**Common question:** *"Can't I just do this later?"*

Sure. But later usually means:
- Starting over with a new attorney
- Gathering all the same documents again
- Missing opportunities for tax-advantaged structures
- Leaving gaps in your asset protection

**Better question:** *"What does this actually involve?"*

For most clients: 2-3 meetings, straightforward planning, peace of mind.

**Your biggest investment deserves comprehensive protection.**

If you recently closed (or are about to), let's talk about the smart next step.

### Example 4: Monthly Newsletter - Residential Referral Sources

**Subject Line:** What's changing in NYC co-op boards (and what it means for your deals)

**From:** Andrew Luftig, CPL Law Firm
**To:** NYC Residential Broker Network
**Format:** Monthly industry insights + practical tips

#### **Email Content:**

**Hi [First Name],**

I'm seeing a pattern in October closings that's worth flagging for you:

**Co-op boards are getting MORE selective, not less.**

Even in a market where inventory is tight and buyers are plentiful, boards are taking their time. Here's what we're seeing:

**📊 By the numbers:**
- Average board review time: Up from 14 days to 21 days (vs. last year)
- Requests for supplemental financial documentation: Up 35%
- Board interview "rescheduling": Up 2x

**Why this matters for your deals:**

**1. Add time to your closing estimates**
If you're telling buyers "30-45 days after contract," you might need to start saying "45-60 days." Under-promising > over-promising.

**2. Prep your buyers harder**
Boards are asking more questions about employment stability, income sources, and references. Your buyers need to be READY.

**3. Watch for these red flags**
- Self-employment without 3+ years history
- Recent job changes (even for more money)
- Any credit inquiries during the purchase process

**📞 Quick favor:**

If you have a buyer in contract and ANY of these apply, loop me in early. We can head off problems before they become deal-killers.

**What we're seeing work:**

- Pre-submission package reviews (catches 80% of issues)
- Board interview prep calls (15 minutes, makes a difference)
- Direct communication with managing agents (when appropriate)

**The goal:** Get your buyers approved. Protect your commission. Close on time.

Hit reply if you have questions about a specific deal. I read every response.

### Example 5: Monthly Newsletter - Commercial Referral Sources

**Subject Line:** Commercial financing changes you need to know (Q4 2025)

**From:** Alan Perlowitz, CPL Law Firm
**To:** Commercial Broker & Lender Network
**Format:** Quarterly market intelligence + insights

---

#### **Email Content:**

**[First Name]—**

Quick update from the commercial finance world that's affecting deals right now:

**Banks are tightening construction loan terms.**

Not declining deals—just being more conservative on structures. Here's what's changed:

**📉 What banks are doing:**
- Lower loan-to-cost ratios (70% vs. 75-80% six months ago)
- More scrutiny on sponsor liquidity requirements
- Shorter interest-only periods (12-18 months vs. 24 months)
- Higher reserve requirements for operating expenses

**🎯 What this means for your deals:**

**For Brokers:**
Your developer clients need bigger equity checks than they expected. Loop in their CFO/financing team early. "Pre-qualified" from 6 months ago ≠ "approved" today.

**For Lenders:**
Your borrowers might need gap financing or mezzanine debt to make the numbers work. If you're seeing deals stall, that's likely why.

**💡 Here's where the CPA+Attorney license helps:**

Most attorneys will tell you "the bank won't approve this structure."

I can show you 3-4 alternative structures that:
- Meet the bank's new requirements
- Optimize the borrower's tax position
- Keep the deal moving forward

**Recent example:** $18M acquisition that was dead because of new LTV requirements. Restructured with preferred equity layer + operating company split. Bank approved. Tax-efficient. Closed in 42 days.

**Two things I can help with:**

1️⃣ **Pre-deal structure review** (15-minute call, no charge)
See if there are better ways to structure before you're deep in diligence.

2️⃣ **Bank-rejected deal consultation**
If a deal got turned down for structure reasons, I'll take a look. Sometimes there's a path forward.

#### **Blog Outline:**

**Title:** The NYC Homebuyer's Complete Legal Checklist: What You Actually Need to Know

**Meta Description:** Buying your first NYC apartment? This comprehensive legal checklist from CPL Law Firm covers co-ops, condos, and townhouses—everything you need before, during, and after closing.

---

**INTRODUCTION (200 words)**

**Hook:** "You're about to make the biggest financial decision of your life. Here's the legal roadmap nobody gives you."

**StoryBrand Elements:**
- Hero: NYC homebuyer
- Problem: Overwhelming legal requirements, fear of missing something critical
- Guide: CPL with decades of NYC-specific expertise

**Promise:** By the end of this guide, you'll know exactly what to expect legally, what to ask your attorney, and how to avoid the most common (and expensive) mistakes.

---

**SECTION 1: Before You Make an Offer (400 words)**

**What to do BEFORE you're in contract:**

1. **Understand the building type differences**
   - Co-op vs. Condo vs. Townhouse (legal implications)
   - What "proprietary lease" means
   - Why co-ops are more restrictive

2. **Get pre-approved (not just pre-qualified)**
   - Bank letters matter to sellers
   - What boards actually look at
   - Self-employment considerations

3. **Choose your attorney early**
   - Why "my friend's attorney" might not specialize in NYC real estate
   - Questions to ask your attorney before hiring
   - Red flags in attorney selection

**CPL Insight Box:**
"We review the offering plan and financial statements BEFORE our clients make an offer. Why? Because 20% of the time, we find something that changes the decision: special assessments coming, building litigation, or board financial problems. Better to know before you're emotionally invested."

---

**SECTION 2: After Your Offer is Accepted (500 words)**

**The contract phase:**

1. **The 10-day attorney review period**
   - What this actually means
   - Why you MUST use this time wisely
   - Contract negotiations we see most often

2. **Due diligence checklist:**
   - Building financials to request
   - Board meeting minutes (what to look for)
   - Certificate of insurance review

   - What inspections are required vs. recommended
   - How inspection results affect negotiations
   - Dealing with inspection surprises

**Common Mistakes Box:**
"Waiving the attorney review period to make your offer more attractive? We've seen this backfire dozens of times. The 'savings' of a few days isn't worth discovering a $50K special assessment after you've removed your contingencies."

**For co-ops (the most complex part):**

1. **What goes in your board package**

   - Inconsistent information across forms
   - Unprofessional reference letters

**CPL Process:**
"We send our clients a comprehensive checklist at contract signing. Then we review the complete package before submission—not after. Boards won't review incomplete packages, and every day of delay costs you money in financing rate locks and bridge loan interest."

#### **Blog Outline:**

**Title:** 5 Tax Traps in Commercial Real Estate Deals (And How a CPA+Attorney Sees What Others Miss)

**Meta Description:** Commercial real estate tax planning should happen BEFORE you sign. Alan Perlowitz (CPA, Esq.) shares the 5 most expensive tax mistakes and how to avoid them.

---

**INTRODUCTION (150 words)**

**Hook:** "Most commercial real estate attorneys will get your deal closed. But they won't see the $340K in unnecessary taxes until it's too late."

**Problem:** Legal expertise ≠ Tax expertise. By the time your deal structure is finalized, your tax planning options are limited.

**Solution:** Having both CPA and attorney credentials means seeing tax implications BEFORE they become problems.

**Promise:** "In this post, I'll walk you through the 5 most expensive tax mistakes I see in commercial deals—and the specific strategies we use to avoid them."

---

**SECTION 1: Tax Trap #1 - Wrong Entity Structure (400 words)**

**The Problem:**
Most deals default to simple LLC structures because they're easy. But "easy" often means "expensive" at tax time.

**Real Example:**
"Client was buying a $6.5M mixed-use building in Brooklyn. Original structure: Single-member LLC purchasing the property.

Tax bill at year 5 sale: $890K in capital gains.

**After restructuring:** Partnership LLC with specific allocation provisions + qualified opportunity zone consideration.

**Result:** Tax bill at year 5: $490K. **Savings: $400K.**"

**Why attorneys miss this:**
They're optimizing for legal liability protection. CPAs optimize for tax efficiency. You need both.

**What to do instead:**
- Evaluate entity structure based on hold period
- Consider partnership structures with allocations
- Look at qualified opportunity zones where applicable
- Plan for exit strategy from day one

**Questions to ask your attorney:**
1. "Have you evaluated this structure from a tax perspective?"
2. "What does my tax bill look like in year 5 vs. year 10?"
3. "Are there entity structures that would reduce my overall tax burden?"

---

**SECTION 2: Tax Trap #2 - Missed 1031 Exchange Opportunities (350 words)**

**The Problem:**
1031 exchanges can defer huge capital gains taxes—but the rules are strict and the windows are tight.

**Real Example:**
"Developer client sold a $4.2M property. Planned to close in March, start looking for replacement property after closing.

**Problem:** You have 45 days to IDENTIFY replacement property and 180 days to CLOSE. Waiting until after closing? You've wasted 30-60 days.

We restructured to have replacement properties identified BEFORE the sale closed. Completed the exchange. Deferred $680K in capital gains taxes."

**Common 1031 mistakes:**
- Not using a qualified intermediary (required)
- Missing the 45-day identification deadline
- "Like-kind" property misunderstanding
- Not planning for financing on replacement property

**The CPA+Attorney advantage:**
Tax attorneys know 1031 rules. CPAs know tax strategy. Real estate attorneys know deal structures. Having all three? You get deals structured FOR 1031 success from the beginning.

**Checklist for 1031 consideration:**
- [ ] Are you selling investment property?
- [ ] Do you have >$500K in potential capital gains?
- [ ] Can you identify replacement property within 45 days?
- [ ] Have you engaged a qualified intermediary?

---

**SECTION 3: Tax Trap #3 - Improper Cost Segregation (300 words)**

**The Problem:**
You're depreciating your entire building over 39 years when components could be depreciated much faster.

**What is cost segregation?**
Breaking down your building purchase into components:
- Land (not depreciable)
- Building structure (39 years)
- Personal property (5-7 years)
- Land improvements (15 years)

**Real Example:**
"$12M commercial building purchase. Standard depreciation: ~$300K/year for 39 years.

After cost segregation study: ~$800K in accelerated depreciation in year 1-5.

**Cash flow impact:** Reduced tax bill by $280K in first 5 years."

**When cost segregation makes sense:**
- Purchase price >$2M
- Property will be held 5+ years
- Owner has other income to offset (passive loss rules apply)

**The planning piece most attorneys miss:**
Cost segregation should be considered IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT. Why? Certain provisions in the purchase agreement can affect how you allocate the purchase price for tax purposes.

---

**SECTION 4: Tax Trap #4 - Ignoring Passive Loss Limitations (350 words)**

**The Problem:**
You bought commercial real estate for the depreciation deductions. But you can't actually USE them because of passive loss rules.

**Passive Loss Rules 101:**
- Real estate losses are generally "passive"
- Passive losses can only offset passive income
- If you're a "real estate professional," different rules apply

**Real Example:**
"Tech company CEO bought $8M in commercial property for depreciation benefits.

**Year 1 paper loss:** $400K (great!)
**Year 1 tax benefit:** $0 (not great)

**Why?** His W-2 income ($1.2M) is 'active income.' His real estate losses are 'passive losses.' They don't offset each other.

**Solution:** Restructure to create passive income streams that CAN be offset by passive losses, or consider real estate professional status for spouse."

**Questions to ask BEFORE buying commercial property for tax benefits:**

1. "What type of income do I have?" (W-2, business income, investment income)
2. "Can I actually USE these depreciation deductions?"
3. "Do I qualify as a real estate professional?" (750+ hours/year in real estate, material participation)
4. "What's my long-term exit strategy?"

**The CPA+Attorney advantage:**
We model your tax situation BEFORE you're in contract. No surprises about whether you can actually benefit from the tax deductions.

---

**SECTION 5: Tax Trap #5 - Poor Exit Strategy Planning (350 words)**

**The Problem:**
You're optimizing for purchase, not for exit. Five years later, you realize you've trapped yourself.

**Exit strategies and their tax implications:**

**1. Straight sale**
- Capital gains tax (federal + state)
- Depreciation recapture (25% federal)
- NYC UBT for certain entities

**2. 1031 Exchange**
- Tax deferral (not elimination)
- Must reinvest ALL proceeds
- Replacement property must be "like-kind"

**3. Installment sale**
- Spread tax liability over multiple years
- Interest income considerations
- Related party restrictions

**4. Charitable remainder trust**
- For highly appreciated property
- Eliminates capital gains
- Creates income stream
- Requires charitable intent

**5. Step-up basis at death**
- Estate planning consideration
- Heirs get property at FMV (not your cost basis)
- Eliminates built-in capital gains

**Real Example:**
"Client owned $18M commercial building (cost basis: $6M) for 15 years. Wanted to sell and retire.

**Standard sale tax bill:** $3.8M (federal + state + depreciation recapture)

**Structured exit:** Partial 1031 into smaller property (reduced management), installment sale for remaining 40%, qualified opportunity zone reinvestment for 10%.

**Result:** Tax bill spread over 10 years + significant deferral. More cash flow for retirement."

**The planning imperative:**
Exit strategy should be discussed at PURCHASE, not 5 years later when you're ready to sell.

---

**CONCLUSION (200 words)**

**The Main Point:**
"Commercial real estate tax planning isn't something you do at tax time. It's something you do BEFORE you sign the purchase agreement."

**Why CPA+Attorney matters:**
Most attorneys will get your deal closed legally. Most CPAs will file your taxes accurately. Very few professionals have BOTH credentials to see tax implications during deal structuring.

**What this means for you:**
- Better deal structures from day one
- Lower tax bills over the hold period
- More flexibility at exit
- Higher actual returns (not just paper returns)

**Next Steps:**
"If you're considering a commercial property acquisition and want a second set of eyes on the tax strategy—even if you already have an attorney and CPA—I offer a complimentary 15-minute call to see if there are opportunities being missed.

No charge. No obligation. Just a quick look from someone who sees both sides."

### Scaling Content Production

**Weekly Content Calendar Example (75/25 Split):**

**Monday:** LinkedIn post - Andrew (Residential referral source) - 40%
**Tuesday:** LinkedIn post - Alan (Commercial referral source) - 35%
**Wednesday:** Blog post (Direct client educational content) - 25%
**Thursday:** Email newsletter prep (Referral sources)
**Friday:** Social media engagement + responses

**Monthly:**
- 4-5 LinkedIn posts per partner (Andrew + Alan)
- 2-3 blog posts (mix of residential, commercial, estate planning)
- 1 email newsletter per partner (Andrew to residential network, Alan to commercial network)
- 1-2 downloadable resources (lead magnets)

**Quarterly:**
- 1 comprehensive guide (e.g., "NYC Real Estate Q4 Market Report")
- 1 webinar or video series
- Seasonal content (tax planning deadlines, market trends)

---

### Content Repurposing Strategy

**One core piece of content becomes many:**

**Example: Alan writes blog post "5 Tax Traps in Commercial Deals"**

**Repurpose into:**
1. LinkedIn post series (5 posts, one trap per post)
2. Email newsletter (condensed version with CTA to full blog)
3. Video series (5 short videos, 2-3 minutes each)
4. Downloadable PDF guide (lead magnet)
5. Webinar topic (expanded with Q&A)
6. Newsletter content for commercial lender network
7. Speaking engagement content for broker events

**Result:** 1 piece of content → 7+ touchpoints across multiple channels
