## LEVEL 6: Objection Responses

### Common Objections Across Audiences

**OBJECTION: "Your fees seem high."**
- **Response:** "Our fees are competitive with other NYC real estate specialists, and we offer transparent flat-fee structures where possible. More importantly, our clients stay with us because of our service quality and proactive issue flagging—the cheapest attorney often costs more when they miss problems or aren't accessible when you need them. We're an investment in peace of mind and smooth transactions."
- **When to Use:** Fee discussions with brokers or direct clients
- **Tone:** Confident, value-focused, not defensive

---

**OBJECTION: "I already have an attorney I use."**
- **Response (to Brokers):** "That's great—strong attorney relationships are important. I'd still love to connect in case you ever need a backup or want to compare experiences for specific situations. Can I send you our monthly market insights to stay in touch?"
- **Response (to Clients):** "I understand loyalty to someone you've worked with. If your situation changes or you'd like a second opinion on something, we're here. Many of our best client relationships started as second opinions that became primary representation."
- **When to Use:** Initial relationship building
- **Tone:** Respectful, non-aggressive, long-term relationship focus

---

**OBJECTION (Commercial): "You're known as a residential firm—can you handle sophisticated commercial deals?"**
- **Response:** "Great question, and it's actually our competitive advantage. Alan is on bank-approved lender lists nationwide and brings CPA+Attorney dual credentials to commercial work—that's institutional sophistication. What makes us different is we bring our residential service culture to commercial practice. You get big-firm capabilities with boutique accessibility and no 'big ego' attitudes. Let me connect you with commercial clients and brokers who can speak to our capabilities."
- **When to Use:** Commercial audience skepticism
- **Tone:** Confident, reframe concern as advantage, offer proof

---

**OBJECTION (Recruiting): "I'm concerned about leaving a prestigious firm."**
- **Response:** "Prestige is only valuable if it's sustainable. Many attorneys burn out at large firms and exit law entirely—that's the real career risk. CPL has bank-approved credentials and sophisticated work, so you maintain practice caliber. The difference is sustainable hours, partnership track transparency, and collaborative culture that let you build a long-term career. Talk to our associates about the reality—we'll connect you directly."
- **When to Use:** Attorney recruiting conversations
- **Tone:** Empathetic, reframe risk, offer direct proof via current attorneys

---

**OBJECTION: "Will I work with you or an associate?"**
- **Response (Residential):** "You'll work directly with Andrew. We have support staff for administrative tasks, but Andrew personally reviews every contract, handles your closing, and is available for questions. You'll have his direct phone number and email."
- **Response (Commercial):** "You'll work directly with Alan. Unlike large firms that promise partner attention then delegate to associates, Alan is personally involved in transactions. You're paying for partner-level expertise—you should get partner-level attention."
- **When to Use:** Client hesitation about delegation
- **Tone:** Clear differentiation from competitors, accountability
